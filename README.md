# Numpy
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains my work with NumPy, a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It includes various implementations of NumPy functions, operations, and concepts such as array manipulations, mathematical functions, linear algebra, and statistical computations.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
Basic NumPy Operations: Creating arrays, indexing, slicing, and reshaping.
Linear Algebra: Matrix operations, dot product, eigenvalues, and solving equations.
Statistical Operations: Mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation.
Broadcasting & Vectorization: Optimized operations for large datasets.
ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings
Efficient numerical computations with NumPy
Optimizing code using broadcasting
Hands-on experience with linear algebra and statistical functions
